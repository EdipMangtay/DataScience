## üëã About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as my personal knowledge base, practice ground, and project portfolio as I navigate the exciting world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Here, I document my progress through various courses, share my code implementations from exercises and personal explorations, and eventually, showcase my end-to-end portfolio projects.

My ultimate goal is to become an **AI/ML Engineer** with a strong focus on **MLOps**, capable of not just building models, but deploying and managing them effectively in production.

## üìö Current Learning Focus (October 2025 - Phase 1: Foundation)

I am currently building a solid foundation by focusing on the core principles and tools of Data Science and Machine Learning through a multi-platform approach:

1.  **[Udemy] Python ile A'dan Z'ye Veri Bilimi ve Machine Learning (Atƒ±l Samancƒ±oƒülu):** My primary source for comprehensive theoretical understanding and practical examples in Python.
    * *Status:* In Progress
    * *Key Learnings:* Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn basics.

2.  **[DataCamp] Associate Data Scientist in Python Career Track:** Reinforcing theoretical knowledge with hands-on, interactive coding exercises.
    * *Status:* In Progress
    * *Key Learnings:* Advanced Pandas, SQL, Statistical Thinking, Core ML Algorithms practice.

3.  **[Book] Essential Math for Data Science (Hadrien Jean):** Strengthening the underlying mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics) using the "Integrated Math Strategy".
    * *Status:* In Progress (Used alongside Udemy/DataCamp)

4.  **[Kaggle Learn] Foundational Courses:** Supplementing my learning with targeted micro-courses and practical exercises.
    * *Completed:* `[List completed Kaggle Learn courses like Pandas, Data Visualization here]`
    * *In Progress:* `[List ongoing Kaggle Learn courses here]`

## üó∫Ô∏è My Learning Roadmap Overview

This repository will evolve according to my structured learning plan:

* **Phase 1 (Current): Foundation** - Mastering Python, Data Analysis, SQL, Core ML Algorithms.
* **Phase 2: Specialization Bridge** - Deep dive into MLOps concepts, Software Engineering for DS, potentially using DataCamp's ML Engineer track.
* **Phase 3: Professional Summit** - Targeting the **Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer** certification path (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud ML Pipelines).
* **Phase 4: Application** - Building **End-to-End Portfolio Projects** and actively participating in **Kaggle Competitions**.
